# PORTFOLIO
Hi, you found yourself to the code of my own personal portfolio. I would like to welcome you.
My name is Lawrence, a 21 year old web designer / developer from Antwerp.

This project will serve as my own personal portfolio, which will only improve as the years go by, so this will probably be the longest 'work in project' file of my carreer.

## The site
The site consists of four differnet sections:
- HOME
- ABOUT
- PORTFOLIO
- CONTACT

The titles speak for themselves, but you're more than welcome to come take a look at the site over here:
((place for future link to site)).

### The code
The code of the site, for now, will be very basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
As I learn more and more during the course of my carreer, I might implement some more cool tech into my code. But for now, I'd rather stich to the basics.

### Status updates:
You will find some updates from my most recent pushes over here.

UPDATE:
- Initialized the project with some code added already for the responsiveness of the navigation.

### Closing thoughts
So here we are at the end of this README.
Hope you enjoyed your stayed and liked some things that you saw on my site.

If you have any thoughts, opinions or tips on how I could improve my portfolio or any part of my code. You can always send me a message.

Thanks for checking ou my repo and maybe talk to you soon.

Staty safe, stay healthy, and most importantly, stay creative.
Kind regards
Lawrence
